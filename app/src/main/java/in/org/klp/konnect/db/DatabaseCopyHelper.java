/**
 * Created by bibhas on 6/19/16.
 *
 * This is only for handling the copying process of the database.
 * The SQLiteAssetHelper is a plugin that takes the database from
 * /main/assets/databases/konnect.db to the device location where
 * the app can use it. And this plugin only works with the inbuilt
 * SqliteOpenHelper. But we're using SquiDB to deal with database
 * queries right now. And SquiDB and SQLiteAssetHelper cannot work
 * together. Hence this class is here only so that SQLiteAssetHelper
 * can use it to copy the database.
